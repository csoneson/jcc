  abstract = "Most methods for statistical analysis of RNA-seq data take a
              matrix of abundance estimates for some type of genomic features
              as their input, and consequently the quality of any obtained
              results are directly dependent on the quality of these
              abundances. Here, we present the junction coverage compatibility
              (JCC) score, which provides a way to evaluate the reliability of
              transcript-level abundance estimates as well as the accuracy of
              transcript annotation catalogs. It works by comparing the
              observed number of reads spanning each annotated splice junction
              in a genomic region to the predicted number of junction-spanning
              reads, inferred from the estimated transcript abundances and the
              genomic coordinates of the corresponding annotated transcripts.
              We show that while most genes show good agreement between the
              observed and predicted junction coverages, there is a small set
              of genes that do not. Genes with poor agreement are found
              regardless of the method used to estimate transcript abundances,
              and the corresponding transcript abundances should be treated
              with care in any downstream analyses.",

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is
              a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
              non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
              lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
              technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
              high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
              limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80
              billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed
              the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
              based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm
              that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed
              suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching
              procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in
              mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2
              $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core
              server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity
              and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of
              canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and
              chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping
              full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse
              transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we
              experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions
              with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of
              the STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR
              is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source
              software distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded
              from http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.",
