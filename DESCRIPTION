Title: Calculate JCC Scores
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Charlotte Soneson and Michael I Love
Maintainer: Charlotte Soneson <charlottesoneson@gmail.com>
Description: The JCC scores are aimed at detecting genes for which estimated 
    transcript abundances are unreliable, either because of problems in the 
    transcript abundance estimation or because of missing or wrongly annotated 
    reference transcripts. It does so by comparing the number of reads 
    predicted to align across each junction, inferred from the transcript 
    abundances and a fragment bias model, to the observed number of 
    junction-spanning reads, obtained via alignment of the reads to the genome. 
    A high JCC score for a gene indicates that the estimated abundances for 
    the corresponding transcripts are unreliable and should be treated with 
    care in downstream analyses.
